Need to understand abt:
- PoP (Points of Presence)
- Caching Servers
- Reverse Proxy Technology - Done
- Forward Proxy Technology - Done
- Scrubbing Servers
- DDoS attack and protection
- Caching Algos


Achievables through CDN:
- Performance
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Responsivness

CDN Topology:
- Scattered CDN - This topology focus is on optimal physical proximity
- Consolidated CDNs - operate a small number of high-capacity PoPs, which are strategically positioned in major data centers, to serve a wider populace

Inside CDN Caching Servers:
- increased RAM and CPU throughput, complemented by a high-capacity solid state drives (SSDs). RAM and SSD are used to provide high-speed access to cached objects, with RAM—being the faster of the two—used to store the more frequently-used items.
- CDNs are about speed, and benchmark tests show SSDs to be significantly faster—even when compared to 7200 rpm HDDs.


So What Can a CDN Do for Me?
Modern CDNs can handle numerous IT tasks, helping you to:
- Improve page load speed
- Handle high traffic loads
- Block spammers, scrapers and other bad bots
- Localize coverage without the cost
- Reduce bandwidth consumption
- Load balance between multiple servers
- Protect your website from DDoS attacks
- Secure your application
